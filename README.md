# GUI
#import all the elements/library from the Tkinter which is mostly used in GUI
#from tkinter import* 

#Everything in Kinter is a widget, like text, frame, button widget etc
#root = Tk() #The root widget

#Creating a window with a Label widget (ArdaCiTi)
#my_name = Label(root, text = "ArdaCiTi") 

my_name.pack() #Think of the pack more like when you pack your car, you find the closest available space and just pack there, so is pretty much the same

root = mainloop()
